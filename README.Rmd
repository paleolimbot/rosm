Download and plot [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps), and other tiled map sources. A previous version
of this package provided an API for plotting base maps; the new API is more
low-level and covers tile math, URL generation, and fetching tiles in parallel.

## Installation

The **rosm** package is [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rosm), and can be installed using `install.packages("rosm")`.

## Example

```{r example}
library(rosm)

bounds <- wk::rct(
  -7476083, 5349058,
  -6594103, 6243203,
  crs = osm_crs_native()
)

(grd <- osm_raster(bounds, osm_url_spec_example()))
plot(grd)
```
