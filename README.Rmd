[![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/rosm)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rosm)  [![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/paleolimbot/rosm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paleolimbot/rosm) [![Coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/paleolimbot/rosm/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/paleolimbot/rosm?branch=master)

Download and plot [Open Street Map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Bing Maps](http://www.bing.com/maps), and other tiled map sources. Use to create high-resolution basemaps and add hillshade to vector based maps. Note that rosm uses base plotting and not ggplot2: for mapping in ggplot2, use [ggspatial](https://github.com/paleolimbot/ggspatial)::annotation_map_tile().

## Installation

The **rosm** package is [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rosm), and can be installed using `install.packages("rosm")`.

## Example

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', fig.show='hold'}
library(prettymapr)
library(rosm)

# specify a bounding box
altalake <- makebbox(50.1232, -122.9574, 50.1035, -123.0042)
prettymap({
  # plot tiles (see also osm.raster() and bmaps.plot())
  osm.plot(altalake)
  osm.points(c(-122.9841, -122.9812), c(50.11055, 50.11765), 
             pch=15, cex=0.6, col="white")
  osm.text(c(-122.9841, -122.9812), c(50.11055, 50.11765), 
           labels=c("GC6", "GC2"), adj=c(-0.2, 0.5), cex=0.7, col="white")
}, scale.label.col = "white")
```


## The Future?

Some other great projects have popped up in the last few years, such that **rosm** will probably be retired in the next year. Packages that depend on will continue to work, but it is likely that a new API will pop up under a different name.
